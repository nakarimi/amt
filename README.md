It is the biggest Drupal project for a dance studio course that I worked on. It is a web application and facilitates managing thousands of appointments per week, managing payment, enrollment, attendance and classes for instructors and students. It contains many features like importing all entities from csv, generating and sending multiple reports to third party services by API. It has many custom modules as well that you can find the source code in my repository.
