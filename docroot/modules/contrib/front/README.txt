Introduction
================

This module is for people who want a custom front page to their Drupal sites.

For all bugs, feature requests or support requests please use the
Front Page issue queue at http://drupal.org/project/issues/front


Key Functionality
=====================

1. Allows you to specify a custom front page based on role type using 301 Redirect.

2. Override Home Links to go to another local path. This could be to stop users
    going back to a splash screen.



Installation
===============

1. Upload and install the Front Page module.

2. Go to Administer -> Config -> Front Page.

3. Expand any of the roles that you want to override the default front page and
    select the appropriate method of override as well as filling in the variables
    required for that method. Once the settings are correct save the form.

4. Enable the 'Front Page Override' checkbox and then save the form. The front
    page module should now be working correctly.
